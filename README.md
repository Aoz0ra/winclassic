Windows Classic theme designer: a utility to help ease the development of Windows Classic themes.

This tool allows you to design a Windows Classic theme without needing Windows' Window Appearance dialog. Currently, you can only customize the colours (which is really the most significant part of the theme), even the hidden ones.

*More documentation will be added once there is something usable*

One of my hobbies is to develop themes using the [Windows Classic style](winclassic).
This, of course, requires Windows. When I managed to finally install Arch Linux and made it my primary OS, I was left with two options if I wanted to continue the hobby: reboot to Windows whenever I wanted to develop a theme, or boot a virtual machine.

Rebooting to Windows is highly impractical. My computer only has 4 GB of memory, so booting a virtual machine also wouldn't work very well. This tool is the result of this problem.
